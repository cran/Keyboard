Description: We developed a package 'Keyboard' for designing single-agent, drug-combination, or phase I/II dose-finding clinical trials. The 'Keyboard' designs are novel early phase trial designs that can be implemented simply and transparently, similar to the 3+3 design, but yield excellent performance, comparable to those of more-complicated, model-based designs (Yan F, Mandrekar SJ, Yuan Y (2017) <doi:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-0220>, Li DH, Whitmore JB, Guo W, Ji Y. (2017) <doi:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-1125>,  Liu S, Johnson VE (2016) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxv040>, Zhou Y, Lee JJ, Yuan Y (2019) <doi:10.1002/sim.8475>, Pan H, Lin R, Yuan Y (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.cct.2020.105972>). The 'Keyboard' package provides tools for designing, conducting, and analyzing single-agent, drug-combination, and phase I/II dose-finding clinical trials.
